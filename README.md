🎮 Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe ✨
Welcome to the Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game, a twist on the classic! 🕹️

🔍 Game Rules:
Players: 2 (Player X and Player O) 🤺
Gameplay: Players take turns marking a spot on the 3x3 grid.
Special Rule: After the 4th move, the first move made by either player is erased. 🎲
Winning: The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins! 🏆

⚙️ How it Works:
The game keeps track of each player's moves in a circular queue (a fancy way of storing moves! 😉).
Once the 4th move is made, the first move gets removed automatically. 🧹
The game checks for a winner after every move.
If there is a winner, the game announces the winner and resets. 🔄

💻 Features:
Stylish 3x3 grid where players place their X or O. ✨
Interactive UI with smooth animations. 🖱️
Visual feedback on moves made by each player (opacity effect). 👀
The game resets after a win or a draw, ready for another round! 🔁
